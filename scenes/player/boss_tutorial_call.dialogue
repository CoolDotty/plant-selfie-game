Boss: Just the person I wanted to talk to! Today's your first day!
Boss: We just opened up, so the place is looking pretty sparse, but that's where you come in!
Boss: Try taking some photos with your phone and posting it on our socials, ya know, marketing...stuff...
Boss: I bet with a little market research, you'll attract our customers like a bee to a honeysuckle... or something like that.
Boss: Good luck!
